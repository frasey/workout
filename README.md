<!-- you should add a readme, it should contain the following -->
<!-- 1. context to the program, what is this, when did you do it, what are the technoglies used/what is needed to run the app-->
<!-- 2. some screen shots of the app, even better a youtube video, even even better host it online but that's like a whole project of it's own -->
<!-- 3. a _STEP_ by _STEP_ guide on how to get the app running-->
<!-- 4. add a seed  file so if someone wants to checkout your app they have some data to work with-->
